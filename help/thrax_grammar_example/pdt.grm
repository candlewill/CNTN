# Simple example of PDT grammar. Recognizes a^n b^n.
# Test as follows:
# thraxrewrite-tester --far=pdt.far --rules=PDT\$PARENS

import 'byte.grm' as bytelib;

export PARENS = ("[<S>]" : "[</S>]");

export PDT = ("[<S>]" "a")* ("b" "[</S>]")*;

# This is just for illustrative purposes, to show how to use PdtCompose:

sigma = bytelib.kBytes;

export PDT2 = PdtCompose[sigma*, PDT, PARENS, 'right_pdt'];
