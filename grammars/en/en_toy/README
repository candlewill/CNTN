This is a toy classifier for English whose sole purpose is to accompany the
documentation on GitHub, illustrating how to write grammars for Sparrowhawk.

It is assumed you have OpenGrm Thrax version 1.2.1 or higher installed. If you
do not then the first thing to do is go to:

http://openfst.cs.nyu.edu/twiki/bin/view/GRM/Thrax

and follow the instructions there.

Paul Dixon's Windows port can be found at:

http://openfst.cs.nyu.edu/twiki/bin/view/Contrib/OpenGrmThraxWin

Once Thrax is installed you should go into the classify directory and do:

thraxmakedep tokenize_and_classify.grm
make

Similarly in the verbalize directory:

thraxmakedep verbalize.grm
make

And finally in the verbalize_serialization directory, do the same as above.
